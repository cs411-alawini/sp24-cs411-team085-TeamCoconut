## Project Summary

Disappointed by the limitations in traditional sports databases like ESPN, we aimed to create a unique NBA player statistics application. Our platform offers an independent and intuitive evaluation of every NBA player, from legends to rookies. It combines high-end stats and salary data to assess a player's value, filling a gap left by official sports websites.

Our application not only provides basic features such as player searches and team analysis but also introduces advanced metrics and composite ratings for deeper insights. It stands out by integrating social media debates and expert opinions into our evaluations, offering a comprehensive tool for fans, analysts, and enthusiasts to explore NBA data in a way that's never been done before.
